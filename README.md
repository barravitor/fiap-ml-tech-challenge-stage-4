## Introduction

Project responsible for training a deep learning algorithms for predict price on stocks on B3 [link](https://www.b3.com.br)

## üöÄ Features

- **üîÅ Deep Learning with LSTM**  
  A model based on LSTM neural networks for time series forecasting, ideal for capturing temporal patterns in stock market data.

- **‚öôÔ∏è Automated Preprocessing Pipeline**  
  Includes:
  - Calculation of technical indicators (SMA, RSI)
  - Normalization using `MinMaxScaler`
  - Time window generation
  - Train/test data split

- **üìä Experiment Tracking with MLflow**  
  - Stores trained models with input signature and example
  - Logs key metrics: MAE, RMSE, MAPE
  - Logs training parameters and model architecture
  - Model versioning and artifact storage (models and scalers)

- **üß™ RESTful API with FastAPI**  
  Interface for integration with external systems.

  **Available Endpoints:**
  - `POST /predict`: Sends input data and receives forecast output
  - `GET /health`: Checks API health status

- **üß± Modular and Scalable Architecture**  
  Code organized into reusable modules:
  - `train`, `data_loader`, `forecast_service`, `api`
  - Facilitates maintenance, testing, and extensibility

- **üíæ Scaler Persistence**  
  - Input and output scalers are saved via MLflow and locally with `joblib`
  - Ensures consistent inference and reusability in production

- **üìò Auto-Generated Documentation with Swagger UI**  
  Interactive interface available at `/docs` for testing and exploring API endpoints.

  - [API Swagger](https://fiap-ml-tech-challenge-stage-4-production.up.railway.app/docs)
  - [Full API documentation](./docs/APIDocumentation.md)

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The project's main language, chosen for its rich library for data analysis.
- **scikit-learn**: Library used for statistical modeling and machine learning, including algorithms such as regression, classification, preprocessing, cross-validation, and performance evaluation.
- **numpy**: Fundamental library for numerical computing. Used for high-performance vector operations, matrices and mathematical functions.
- **pandas**: Library used for manipulation and analysis of tabular data, such as reading CSVs, filtering, grouping and data transformations.
- **torch**: Deep learning framework used for building and training neural networks, providing GPU acceleration and automatic differentiation.
- **mlflow**: Open-source platform for managing the machine learning lifecycle, including experiment tracking, model packaging, and deployment.
- **yfinance**: Python library to download historical market data from Yahoo Finance, including stock prices, dividends, and financial statements.
- **FastApi**: Modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
